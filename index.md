# Andie Creel 
I am an environmental economist completing my PhD at the Yale School of the Environment. My research estimates the non-market value of nature-based adaptation solutions to climate change, ecosystem services, and biodiversity, with a focus on integrating these values into the systems that measure welfare, business performance, and fiscal health. I combine behavioral data, such as credit card transactions, mobility records, and time-use surveys, with high-resolution environmental data to reveal how natural resources influence well-being and economic outcomes.

I will be on the job market in 2025-2026.

## *Job Market Paper*: The Value of Nature-Based Adaptation -- Evidence that Tree Cover Protects Urban Revenue from Heat

\[[Link to Working Paper.](working_papers/creel_jmp.pdf)\] Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme heat events, particularly in cities. This paper estimates the causal effect of temperature on daily revenue using over 15,000 consumer-facing storefronts in the 49 largest U.S. cities between 2019 and 2023. Above 35 °C (95 °F), revenue falls steeply, averaging 9 percent lower on days above 37.5 °C (99.5 °F) days than on 20 °C (68 °F) days. Consumption smoothing across days mitigates some damage from an extreme heat event, but a 1.3 percent revenue drop persists for two weeks following a hot day. Therefore, I estimate how effective urban green space is as a climate adaptation strategy that can prevent revenue losses caused by extreme heat ex ante. I find that a one percent increase in tree cover surrounding a storefront increases revenue by 0.94 percent on hot days. A 10 percent increase in surrounding tree cover eliminates revenue losses at 37.5 °C and reduces them by half at 40 °C, relative to areas without canopy. Storefronts located in the Southwest and South have the most to gain from urban tree cover. On average, businesses in this region can cover the cost of moving to a 10 percent tree cover scenario in four years with the avoided revenue losses. This length of time shortens under projected climate scenarios. These results suggest that green infrastructure can improve firm resilience to heat, providing evidence of a private incentive to finance urban green space that could simultaneously provide a positive externality.

## The National Value of Local Outdoor Recreation over the Past 20 Years

\[[Link to Working Paper.](working_papers/creel_local_recreation.pdf)\] I estimate the value of local outdoor recreation in the United States from 2003 to 2023 using the American Time Use Survey and a travel-cost model. I compare two approaches for pricing travel time: (i) welfare-based willingness to pay, valuing time at one-third of own wage, and (ii) accounting values using a replacement wage consistent with household production accounts. Average value per trip is stable at $16–$18 (2023 USD), with temporary increases around the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic. Scaling by trips and population, the national annual value is $231–$241 billion in 2023, roughly $100 billion higher than in the early 2000s. While aggregate trends are similar under both pricing approaches, distributional conclusions differ substantially: using a replacement wage compresses the richest quintile's per-trip value from about 10 times larger than the poorest to only 1.5 times larger. I also use the framework from Drupp et al. (2024, 2025) to infer changes in the natural capital stock that enables recreation. Combining value-per-trip trends with consumption growth, I find that recreation-enabling assets have been roughly maintained over the past two decades, consistent with sustainable management at the national level. This paper produces a scalable, repeatable measure of local recreation benefits at the national level, connects non-market valuation with accounting-consistent pricing, and provides a practical tool for tracking growth of an ecosystem service's enabling natural capital stock when direct measurement is infeasible.

## Measuring the Value of Outdoor Recreation for National Environmental-Economic Statistics

*With Jorge Forero Fajardo and Eli P. Fenichel*

\[[Link to Working Paper.](working_papers/simple_pdfs/creel_sat_accnt.pdf)\] Accurately measuring welfare changes from outdoor recreation requires accounting for both market expenditures and household-produced services, yet current U.S. satellite accounts capture only market transactions. Ignoring the value of recreation under the household production accounting boundary can create a measurement gap for benefit-cost analyses of environmental protection or infrastructure investments, where recreation benefits would be systematically understated. We find that outdoor recreation is primarily a household-produced service that combines purchased inputs (gasoline, equipment) with travel time: the major welfare-relevant cost. Using detailed U.S. coastal recreation data, we partition travel costs across the System of National Accounts boundary (market expenses) and the household production boundary (travel time) to quantify this measurement gap. We find that market expenditures represent only one-third of total recreation costs, while household production of recreation services through travel time comprises two-thirds. This means current assessments using only market expenditures underestimate outdoor recreation's welfare-relevant value by approximately threefold. Including travel time would increase the Household Production Satellite Account by 4-5 percent nationally, corresponding to $12.4 billion in the U.S. Gulf Region or 0.7 percent of regional GDP. For benefit-cost analysis, jointly considering both the SNA and household production boundaries is essential for accurately measuring welfare-relevant expenditure changes over time and properly valuing natural assets that enable outdoor recreation.
