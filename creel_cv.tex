\section*{JOB MARKET PAPER}
\textbf{Do Hot Deals Beat the Heat? Does Green Space Keep Bringing in the Green? The Effects of Heat and Green Space on City Storefronts}: This paper quantifies the economic impact of extreme heat on business revenue and evaluates urban green space as a nature-based climate adaptation. Using daily credit card transaction data, NOAA temperature records, and a novel volumetric green space measure, I estimate a revenue-maximizing “bliss point” around 35°C (95°F), beyond which revenue declines, particularly for leisure businesses. Proximity to green space mitigates these losses, raising the bliss point and reducing heat-related revenue declines. Projecting future revenue impacts under climate scenarios, I estimate potential losses and assess how green space investments could offset economic damages. These findings inform climate adaptation strategies and the valuation of urban green space.
