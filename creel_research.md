# RESEARCH STATEMENT

My research shows how natural capital underpins everyday economic activity, even when it does not appear in markets or national accounts. **I study how people trade off money and time to access nature, and how businesses and governments, in turn, capture value from those choices.** By combining large-scale behavioral data with environmental measures, I make nature’s contributions visible in statistics, businesses’ bottom lines, and fiscal systems. This agenda highlights not only the welfare value of ecosystem services, but also the financial mechanisms that rely on them.



**I focus on publicly provisioned resources such as urban green space and public parks.** In my work, I build and link novel datasets, such as credit card transactions, mobility datasets, and remote sensing, to show how people’s preferences for nature shape both individual welfare and business revenue. **This approach also allows me to ask new questions about distribution**: how environmental benefits vary across demographics, geographic space, and time.

In my job market paper, *Revenue Under Heat: The Value of Urban Green Space*, **I show that urban green space not only buffers consumers from extreme heat but also sustains local business revenue and, in turn, municipal tax bases.** I combine daily credit card transaction data from over 15,000 storefronts in the 53 largest U.S. metropolitan areas with high-resolution temperature and tree canopy measures. Leveraging within-store and within-brand variation across daily maximum temperatures, I find that revenue drops by up to 10 percent on extremely hot days (above 95 °F). Yet moving from no canopy to high canopy (zero to 10 percent coverage) fully offsets the revenue loss from a 99.5 °F day and halves the loss from a 104 °F day.

Because many cities rely on sales or gross receipts taxes, these business gains generate additional fiscal benefits. I estimate how quickly these revenues can offset the costs of expanding tree canopy under different climate scenarios. This framework shows that natural infrastructure can partially “self-finance” through its role in sustaining economic activity, providing a new rationale for municipal investment in climate adaptation. This paper illustrates my broader research approach: observing people’s revealed preferences for natural assets to uncover how natural capital shapes private revenue and public finance.

**My interest in public environmental goods is motivated by the need to incorporate non-market services into national statistics.** A large part of my research agenda is focused on outdoor recreation, especially local recreation, which is one of the most widely consumed ecosystem services but is largely invisible in traditional economic statistics. For example, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) has a satellite account for outdoor recreation, but it does not include the value of time people give up to recreate. Similarly, the Household Production Satellite Account includes services individuals produce for themselves with their own time but excludes recreation (even though it meets the definition of household production).

In a working paper, *Measuring the Value of Outdoor Recreation for National Environmental-Economic Statistics* (with Eli P. Fenichel and Jorge Forero Fajardo), I show how current BEA accounting boundaries obscure the value of recreation. Using coastal recreation data, we partition expenditures between the System of National Accounts and household production accounting boundaries. We find that market spending (e.g., gas, equipment, lodging) represents only one-third of total travel costs, with the majority being travel time. As a result, local recreation, which makes up 77 percent of trips, barely appears in the Outdoor Recreation Satellite Account. When travel time is counted under household production, the Household Production Satellite Account’s value rises by 4 to 5 percent (increasing regional GDP by 0.6 to 0.7 percent). This work demonstrates how accounting conventions shape measured welfare and how travel cost models can recover the hidden value of public natural assets.

In another paper, *The National Value of Local Outdoor Recreation over the Past 20 Years*, **I provide the first long-run, nationally representative estimates of willingness to pay for local recreation in the U.S.** Using a repeated travel cost model with data from the American Time Use Survey (2003 to 2023), I estimate annual welfare values and track distributional patterns. I compare two approaches for monetizing travel time: one from the environmental economics literature and one from household production. The choice of method matters. The traditional approach implies a much larger value gap between high- and low-income households, while the household production approach yields a smaller gap. This project shows how methodological assumptions shape welfare measurement and advances the development of national statistics that capture the value of recreation in aggregate and distributed across people. 

My **commitment to studying how environmental benefits and costs are distributed across demographics, space, and time** reflects a series of formative research experiences. As a research assistant for Kerwin Charles, I examined whether the closure of Black hospitals during integration narrowed the Black–White infant mortality gap and found no measurable effect. This served as an early lesson in testing whether well-intentioned policies deliver equitable outcomes. In my master’s thesis, I used nationwide mobility data to study park use during the early months of COVID-19 and found that people of color and immigrants reduced park visits more than white domestic recreators, suggesting heavier reliance on social forms of outdoor recreation. During an internship at Resources for the Future, I analyzed Land and Water Conservation Fund grants and found them equitably distributed across income groups but disproportionately favoring white counties. Together, these experiences showed me the importance of pairing efficiency-based statistics with distributional analysis to understand how public goods affect welfare in heterogeneous ways. 

**Going Forward:** In my research pipeline, I aim to make visible the economic value of environmental benefits that are individually modest but aggregate to meaningful impacts across households, businesses, and governments. Building on large-scale behavioral and environmental data, I will quantify both the welfare gains from ecosystem services and the costs of environmental degradation, and show how these values flow through people, firms, and fiscal systems.

One line of work will advance the measurement of recreation’s value for national statistics. I plan to develop methods to translate recreation trips into land-based measures of service flows, enabling integration into natural capital accounts. I will also study how recreation functions as a welfare “backstop” during crises such as recessions or pandemics, when budgets are constrained but access to local green space remains essential. Revisiting my COVID park-use research, I intend to examine how social forms of recreation can generate positive externalities in parks, challenging congestion-focused perspectives in the recreation literature.

A second line of inquiry will study how climate change compounds inequities in access to basic needs. Using credit card and mobility data, I plan to estimate the public costs of food deserts under extreme heat. This work builds directly from my job market paper. More broadly, I will examine how environmental stress amplifies the burdens faced by low-income households and marginalized groups in securing everyday necessities such as food.

**Together, these projects will advance my broader agenda: producing environmental-economic statistics that capture the hidden value of nature, inform policy design, and provide new rationales for public finance of natural infrastructure.**
