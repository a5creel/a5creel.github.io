### Full research statement coming soon. 

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Environmental Economics at the Yale School of the Environment. I use revealed preference methods and non-market valuation techniques to quantify how environmental resources contribute to welfare. My research contributes to the development of new national-scale economic statistics that account for the value of natural capital and ecosystem services that are missing from traditional economic measures or misattributed to industry. I also examine how environmental benefits and costs change over time to assess sustainable development goals, their distributions across policy-relevant subpopulations, and spatial variations that affect environmental value. My current research estimates the evolving importance of local recreation opportunities for different demographic groups and explores how urban green spaces serve as economic “insurance” during extreme heat events. Through my research agenda, I aim to help policymakers design resource management strategies that enhance sustainability, improve accessibility to environmental benefits, and support nature-based climate adaptation.
