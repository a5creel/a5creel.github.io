# RESEARCH STATEMENT

My research contributes to developing new national-scale economic statistics that account for the value of natural capital and ecosystem services currently missing from traditional economic measures or misattributed to industry. My work examines how environmental benefits and costs change over time to assess sustainable development goals, distributions of benefits across policy-relevant subpopulations, and spatial variations that affect environmental value. My current research estimates the evolving importance of local recreation opportunities for different demographic groups and explores how urban green spaces serve as economic “insurance” during extreme heat events. My research agenda aims to help policymakers design resource management strategies that enhance sustainability, improve accessibility to environmental benefits, and support nature-based climate adaptation.

I use revealed preference methods and non-market valuation techniques to quantify how environmental resources contribute to welfare. This requires developing theory and structural models and then estimating reduced-form models to calculate the value of ecosystem services in a causal framework.  I use non-traditional datasets to estimate the value of natural resources, like credit card spending data, mobility datasets on foot traffic, and the American Time Use Survey. I complement these datasets on behavior with spatial datasets that measure greenspace, temperature, and other environmental measures. 

**Extreme heat, storefront spending, and urban green space.** My job market paper is motivated by the intensification of the extreme heat and communities need to invest in adaptation. Two distinct research questions are co-motivated by increases in extreme heat, the need for adaptive strategies at the community scale, and interest in nature-based solutions. First, what is the effect of extreme heat on business revenue? Second, what is the effect of nearby green space (a form of natural capital that provides a nature-based climate adaptation) on business revenue, and is there an interaction effect between extreme heat and green space on spending? These results contribute to 1) estimating the fiscal damages of climate change, 2) estimating the non-market value of urban green space and how that value is capitalized into economic activity, and 3) informing climate adaptation strategies. 
 
I adapt the traditional hedonic model to examine how firms producing non-durable, quality-differentiated goods capitalize on environmental attributes in short-run equilibrium. I model heat’s effect with a functionally flexible non-parametric specification. I also interact daily heat with regional climate, to allow the effect of extreme heat to vary spatially. My non-linear temperature specification allows me to identify a “bliss point” at which heat effects on revenue transition from positive to negative. I estimate the interaction effect of greenspace and heat to observe how greenspace increases the bliss point and thus lowers the number of days that extreme heat is economically damaging.  


I find daily revenue is the greatest around 35 degrees Celsius (95F). For leisure businesses, an increase from 35 to 40 degrees Celsius (104F) decreases daily revenue from a 15% increase in revenue above the baseline (0 degrees Celsius) to a 5% increase above the baseline. This trend holds true for all businesses, in addition to leisure business, and is robust to the inclusion of the COVID-19 pandemic and the inclusion of the city of Phoenix (the warmest city in the data). Preliminary results show that, within a brand, greenspace surrounding a storefront dampens the effect of extreme heat. This dampening effect is the largest for greenspace within 200 meters of a storefront.
 
I calculate the changes to revenue from extreme heat under two policy-relevant emission scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5) using the projected climate effects from NASA’s Earth Exchange. I report changes to revenue under these projected scenarios in percent changes and levels, as well under scenarios where urban green space either remains the same or is invested in. These results account for regional heterogeneity. Finally, I estimate changes in state and local sales tax that could be used for investing in urban green space and provide a back-of-the-envelope financial impact benefit-cost analysis. 

**20 Years of Changing Willingness to Pay for Local Outdoor Recreation.** Valuing environmental benefits is essential for sustainably managing natural resources with competing market and non-market uses. I estimate the benefits of local outdoor recreation across two dimensions: temporal trends and sub-population distributions. I provide national-scale, repeated welfare estimates for local recreation using the American Time Use Survey data from 2003 to 2023. I find that the average willingness to pay (WTP) for a local outdoor recreation trip is $18 to $23 in 2023 USD. This WTP has been steady through time, with exceptions around the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic when people had more time for leisure, and the WTP for local recreation trips increased. While the WTP per trip has stayed relatively steady, the annual WTP nationally has increased between $43 to $55 billion 2023 USD over the past two decades, from $173 to $188 billion in 2004 to between $216 and $243 billion in 2022. This increase is partially due to an increase in the average number of local recreation trips taken per year by US residents but is primarily driven by population growth. These benefits exceed the average municipal investments in outdoor recreation more than fourfold, passing a benefit-cost test.
 
Additionally, I investigate the distribution of willingness to pay for local recreation across racial groups and income quintiles by revisiting how travel time is converted to cost in travel cost models. While prior studies predominantly use one-third of the average wage rate as the opportunity cost of time, I propose using a replacement wage approach, which is grounded in household production theory and is more relevant than ever with the advent of the gig economy. This method aligns with how the Bureau of Economic Analysis accounts for household production, making it relevant for national environmental economic statistics. Results show that using the replacement wage has minimal impact on temporal trends in willingness to pay, compared to the one-third wage rate rule, but substantially alters the distribution of benefits. Specifically, using a replacement wage reduces disparities between the highest and lowest income quintiles. This work advances the integration of non-market valuation, like the travel cost model, into national environmental-economic statistics.

**Going Forward:** Going forward, I am eager to focus on valuing ecosystem services that may seem to provide a trivial amount of value when disaggregated (i.e., a single local park trip) but are significant to the populace’s welfare when aggregated to the city, state, or national level. I plan to continue using large datasets on human behavior and natural resource availability to reveal the value of environmental benefits and the cost of degradation. Throughout this work, I want to consider the distribution of benefits or costs across subpopulations like socioeconomic class. I hope to continue expanding my work into the area of public finance, understanding how ecosystem services are capitalized into market transactions that may affect tax revenue. All this work contributes to developing new environmental-economic statistics that can aid in achieving sustainable development. 
    
Specifically, I plan to refine how we quantify the marginal leisure value of an acre of local recreation area, bridging the gap between travel cost models, which measure trips, and natural capital accounting, which requires valuations in terms of acreage. Additionally, I want to investigate how outdoor recreation can provide a welfare backstop during national crises like recessions or pandemics. Finally, I would like to ask how the inequitable cost of extreme heat on people who live in food deserts and are forced to travel for necessities like groceries.
