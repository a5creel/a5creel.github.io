# RESEARCH STATEMENT

My research examines how **businesses capitalize on public natural resources** for private gain and how **people rely on natural amenities for their personal welfare.** The economic value of natural capital and ecosystem services to businesses and people is often missing from traditional economic statistics because these assets are not purchased in a market, leading to misinformed policy and market failures. To estimate this unknown value of environmental goods, **I develop large-scale empirical measures of environmental benefits and costs, quantifying how they vary over time, across space, and among various demographic groups.** My research agenda informs policymakers and managers on how to design resource management strategies that promote sustainability, equitable access, and the long-term productivity of nature’s publicly provisioned benefits.  

My research process requires developing structural or conceptual models so that I can identify how businesses or individuals may make tradeoffs with their money or time to benefit from natural resources. I use large data sets (e.g., mobility and credit card data) and reduced form models to test whether businesses capitalize on natural assets or if individuals enjoy them in the way that I theorized. I like combining these high-frequency datasets with remote sensing or other environmental datasets to reveal information about people’s preferences for environmental assets, and how that affects businesses’ bottom line. The novel data sets I construct allow me to ask important subsequent research questions, such as how preferences for environmental goods and behavior to access them vary across demographics, geographic regions, and time.  

I investigate how **businesses capitalize on public natural resources** in my job market paper, *“Revenue Under Heat: The Value of Urban Green Space”*, and provide evidence that businesses capitalize on publicly provisioned urban green space. I show that businesses benefit from surrounding urban green space generally, but especially on extremely hot days, because of its ability to create a pleasant microclimate. I combine novel daily credit card transaction data from over 15,000 storefronts in the 53 largest U.S. metropolitan areas with high-resolution temperature and remote sensing measures of tree canopy cover. Leveraging within-store and within-brand variation across daily maximum temperatures, I find that business revenue drops as much as 10 percent on extremely hot days (above 95 °C). However, moving from a “no green space” scenario to a “high green space” scenario (10 percent tree canopy coverage) completely mitigates the effect of a 99.5 °F day and halves the damage to revenue from a 104 °F day.  

Because many cities rely on sales or gross receipts taxes, these private gains to businesses caused by urban green space generate additional tax revenue. I estimate how long it would take for these fiscal benefits to offset the costs of expanding canopy cover under various climate scenarios. This framework highlights that urban green space can, in part, **“self-finance”** through its role in sustaining business activity, creating a new rationale for municipal investment in natural infrastructure. This contributes to finding new ways to finance nature-based adaptation strategies to extreme heat, which will only become more frequent and severe with climate change.  

**My interest in how people benefit from public environmental goods is motivated by the desire to better incorporate non-market environmental services into national statistics.** The primary way that I have valued people’s reliance on natural amenities for their personal welfare is in the context of outdoor recreation, with a particular focus on local recreation. Local recreation is a major ecosystem service, yet its economic value is often underrepresented in traditional national-level statistics. For instance, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis has a satellite account for outdoor recreation, but this account does not value the travel time people give up to recreate. The Bureau of Economic Analysis also has a satellite account on household production that values goods or services individuals produce for their own personal consumption, but recreation is not included as a household-produced service in this account, despite its meeting the required definition.  

In our working paper *“Measuring the Value of Outdoor Recreation for National Environmental-Economic Statistics”*, Eli Fenichel, Jorge Forero Fajardo, and I consider how outdoor recreation is already captured in or missing from existing satellite accounts at the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. We use coastal recreation data to partition recreation expenditures between the System of National Accounts and household production boundaries. We show that market expenditures (i.e., gasoline, equipment, and accommodations) capture only about one-third of total travel costs, with the majority being travel time. As a result, local recreation, which accounts for 77 percent of recreation trips, is largely invisible in the Outdoor Recreation Satellite Account. When travel time is valued under the household production boundary, non-market services from recreation increase the household production account’s value by 4 to 5 percent (equivalent to increasing regional GDP by 0.6 to 0.7 percent). These results highlight the importance of accounting boundaries for assessing sustainable development and show how travel time models should be incorporated when valuing nature’s contributions to welfare. This paper illustrates how natural capital accounting can capture the flow of services from public natural assets, aligning directly with my broader research agenda of making environmental benefits visible in core economic measures.  

In another working paper, *“20 Years of Changing Willingness to Pay for Local Outdoor Recreation”*, Eli Fenichel and I investigate how the value of local outdoor recreation (measured as individuals’ willingness to pay) has changed in the United States over the past two decades, and whether these changes differ by income level. We address the lack of national-scale environmental economic statistics measuring the value of local recreation by developing a repeated travel cost model using data from the American Time Use Survey, enabling annual estimates of recreation-related welfare from 2003 to 2023. We also examine how methodological choices affect these estimates by comparing two approaches for monetizing travel time: one from the environmental economics literature and one from the household production literature. Our contribution is twofold. First, we provide the first long-run, nationally representative estimates of willingness to pay for local recreation in the U.S. Second, we highlight how methodological differences in valuing time can influence welfare estimates, with the traditional methodology in the economic literature estimating a much larger gap between the welfare measures for the richest and poorest as compared to using the methodology of time conversion in the household production accounting literature. Our results inform how to improve the development of national statistics on the value of recreation.  

My **commitment to examining how environmental benefits and costs are distributed across demographics, space, and time** was shaped by three formative research experiences. First, as a research assistant for Kerwin Charles, I studied the closure of Black hospitals during integration and its effect on the Black–White infant mortality gap. Finding that integration had no measurable effect on closing the gap underscored the need to rigorously test whether well-intentioned policies achieve their stated goals. Second, my master’s thesis used nationwide mobility data to study park use during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. I found that people of color and immigrants reduced their use of local parks more than white domestic recreators, suggesting that these groups rely more heavily on social forms of outdoor recreation. Finally, during a research internship with Margaret Walls at Resources for the Future, I examined the distribution of Land and Water Conservation Fund grants. Using a modified Suits index, we found that grants were equitably distributed across income groups but disproportionately favored white counties over those with larger populations of people of color. These experiences reinforced the value of coupling efficiency-based statistics with distributional analyses to truly understand how publicly provisioned goods affect people’s welfare in heterogeneous ways.  

**Going Forward:** My future research will continue to make visible the value of environmental benefits that appear trivial when measured at the individual level but are significant when aggregated across cities, states, or nations. This agenda builds on my commitment to using large-scale data on human behavior and natural resources to quantify both the welfare gains from ecosystem services and the costs of environmental degradation, and how these benefits and costs are distributed across income groups, neighborhoods, and regions. By connecting these values to fiscal systems and businesses’ bottom lines, I aim to broaden the scope of public finance to include nature’s contributions to tax bases and economic resilience.  

One line of work will refine how we quantify the marginal leisure value of local recreation space. Current travel cost models focus on trips, while natural capital accounting requires values linked to acreage. Developing methods to bridge this gap will improve how recreation services are incorporated into national statistics. A second line of inquiry will ask how outdoor recreation provides a welfare “backstop” during crises such as recessions or pandemics, when household budgets are constrained but access to local green space remains essential. Finally, I plan to study how climate change compounds inequities in access to basic needs, such as food. In particular, I will examine how extreme heat disproportionately burdens households in food deserts, who must travel further for necessities like groceries.  

Together, these projects advance the development of environmental-economic statistics that inform sustainable development, equitable policy design, and fiscal planning.
