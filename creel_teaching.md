# TEACHING STATEMENT 

Every time I teach, **my goal is to equip future policymakers, industry leaders, and academics with the skills to apply economic insights to real-world challenges.** I see my students as future colleagues and collaborators, and I strive to ensure that all of them, whether they plan to conduct research or use it to support their work, can confidently interpret and apply economic analysis. To achieve this, I focus on developing student’s **technical proficiency and analytical thinking** while making economics, computer science, and applied math **more accessible** to all students in my classroom.

In my first lecture or office hour, **I tell students they have a right to learn all the material** we will cover in my classes or reviews. During my PhD, I have had the opportunity to be the lead instructor for a six-lecture programming workshop for environmental scientists, guest lecture in a graduate-level applied math course, contribute foundation lectures for a new data science certificate program, and be the teaching fellow for many environmental-economic courses. These technical courses have historically been intimidating to students, particularly students who do not see leaders in the field in whom they can see themselves. **I empower students from day one to ask questions and feel they deserve to understand the explanation.** Creating this environment in my classrooms prevents students from falling behind on cumulative topics while increasing students’ belief that these technical fields have a place for anyone excited to learn. Student appreciation of this approach is apparent in my course reviews, with students saying:

- I cannot sing her praises highly enough!!! She was a phenomenal teacher, took far more time with her students than was asked for, showed grace and flexibility when appropriate without seeming like a pushover, and held students to an appropriate standard.
- Andie was beyond incredible. She was incredibly generous with her time and her years of experience. She was committed to ensuring we as students met our personal objectives in the class and was always happy to lend a hand in troubleshooting while still enabling us to develop our own personal skillsets.
- Andie is the best TF I have ever had. She went above and beyond to ensure students had the best learning experience possible. She added valuable context and supplementary material to the course that drew important connections to real-world problems and controversies.
- Andie is one of the best TFs I’ve had at Yale. She is so smart and patient and can explain very complex topics clearly and concisely. She will be an amazing professor someday. Honestly, I would not have been able to survive this class without her help and guidance.

Teaching technical subjects in an interdisciplinary school has motivated me to find **multiple ways to present the same material** so that anyone from humanities students to engineering can leave with an academically mature conceptual understanding. I have found it most beneficial to provide detailed lectured notes, lectures that are paced so that students can take meaningful notes, video recordings so students can revisit the material, and approachable office hours. A recent **example of this multiple-pronged approach occurred while teaching for-loops** during my programming workshop. First, I provided lecture notes on how a four-loop can turn multiple lines of code into far fewer. Second, I wrote the code “live” during the lecture and asked students to follow along on their computers. During office hours, many students were still confused about indexing for-loops. I drew a diagram on the whiteboard and watched the concept click for the students present. In the next lecture, I began with a refined version of the diagram before moving on to the next top. My detailed approach to teaching technical topics is praised by students, with some saying:

- Andie’s notes were incredibly helpful because in class, I was focused on following the steps, and I would check with Andie’s notes to make sure I got everything, and they were much more succinct! Her sessions were always so helpful - Andie is awesome!!
- Andie’s lecture notes were extremely helpful, and her sections and office hours were truly invaluable.
- Andie provides great resources, is available to answer questions, and is extremely kind.

I have also enjoyed the chance to **advise an undergraduate student and a master's student** on two separate research projects. For both, I met with them weekly during an academic year to discuss progress on their work, move them past roadblocks, and establish clear next steps for the following week. The undergraduate was a computer science major and helped me develop functions for data cleaning the American Time Use Survey for use in a Travel Cost Model. The master’s student analyzed how the Bureau of Economic Analysis could adjust existing satellite accounts to better account for the value of local recreation.

Beyond the classroom, **I have mentored undergraduate students through Backcountry Squatters, a non-profit I co-founded in 2018 and led as board president until May 2025.** Backcountry Squatters fosters an inclusive outdoor community by providing leadership opportunities, personal growth, and industry-specific professional development for college women and non-binary students across more than a dozen chapters nationwide. Working closely to support the undergraduate chapter leaders has deepened my understanding of **how students learn best, what they need from mentors, and how to create supportive learning environments that empower them to take ownership of their growth.** These insights directly inform my teaching, where I prioritize active engagement and student-driven learning to help students build confidence in their ability to acquire technical skills.

Ultimately, my teaching is driven by the belief that every student has the right to fully engage with and understand the material. I am committed to fostering an inclusive, supportive, and intellectually rigorous environment where students **grasp complex concepts and gain the confidence to apply them in research, policy, and industry.** Whether through structured lectures, interactive exercises, or personalized mentorship, I strive to make economics, programming, and applied math accessible, engaging, and relevant.

Looking ahead, I am eager to continue refining my approach to teaching and mentoring, developing new ways to equip students with the technical skills needed to tackle real-world challenges. As both an educator and mentor, **my goal is to empower students to see themselves as capable problem solvers, critical thinkers, and future leaders in their fields.**


# Lecture Sample
Below is a lecture I prepared as an instructor for the Yale School of the Environment's Environmental Data Science Certificate Program. This was the first lecture in the Data Foundations module.
